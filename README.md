# Natural-Language-Processing-in-Python-DataCamp


The majority of data is unstructured. This includes information recorded in books, online articles, and audio files. In this track, you’ll gain the core Natural Language Processing (NLP) skills you need to convert that data into valuable insights—from learning how to automatically transcribe TED talks through to identifying whether a movie review is positive or negative. Along the way, you’ll be introduced to popular NLP Python libraries, including NLTK, scikit-learn, spaCy, and SpeechRecognition. You’ll start this track by learning how to identify words and extract topics in text before building your very own chatbot that transforms human language into actionable instructions. By the end of the track, you'll be ready to transcribe audio files and understand how to extract insights from real-world sources, including Wikipedia articles, online review sites, and data from a flight booking system.
